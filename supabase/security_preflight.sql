-- BipolarChat read-only security preflight
-- Safe to run in Supabase SQL Editor before any migration. This file only SELECTs metadata.
-- It does not modify tables, policies, grants, users, or stored data.

-- 1) Public-schema tables and whether RLS is enabled.
select n.nspname as schema_name,
       c.relname as table_name,
       c.relrowsecurity as rls_enabled,
       c.relforcerowsecurity as rls_forced
from pg_class c
join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
where n.nspname = 'public'
  and c.relkind in ('r','p')
order by c.relname;

-- 2) Every policy in public schema. Look for broad USING (true), WITH CHECK (true),
--    duplicate permissive policies, and unexpected roles/commands.
select schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public'
order by tablename, policyname;

-- 3) Explicit grants to browser-facing roles on public tables/views.
select table_schema, table_name, grantee, privilege_type
from information_schema.role_table_grants
where table_schema = 'public'
  and grantee in ('anon','authenticated','service_role')
order by table_name, grantee, privilege_type;

-- 4) Storage policies. Review bucket_id and expressions before enabling private media.
select schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'storage'
order by tablename, policyname;

-- 5) Security-definer functions in public. Review function body/search_path/EXECUTE grants.
select n.nspname as schema_name,
       p.proname as function_name,
       pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid) as arguments,
       p.prosecdef as security_definer,
       p.proconfig as function_settings,
       pg_get_userbyid(p.proowner) as owner
from pg_proc p
join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
where n.nspname = 'public'
  and p.prosecdef
order by p.proname;
